The main purpose of Algebra I is to develop students’ fluency with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. The critical areas of instruction involve deepening and extending students’ understanding of linear and exponential relationships by comparing and contrasting those relationships and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend. In addition, students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using exponential and quadratic functions. Some of the overarching elements of the Algebra I course include the notion of function, solving equations, rates of change and growth patterns, graphs as representations of functions, and modeling.
