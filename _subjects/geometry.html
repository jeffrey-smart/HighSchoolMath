The fundamental purpose of the Geometry course is to introduce students to formal geometric proofs and the study of plane figures, culminating in the study of right-triangle trigonometry and circles. Students begin to formally prove results about the geometry of the plane by using previously defined terms and notions. Similarity is explored in greater detail, with an emphasis on discovering trigonometric relationships and solving problems with right triangles. The correspondence between the plane and the Cartesian coordinate system is explored when students con- nect algebra concepts with geometry concepts. Students ex- plore probability concepts and use probability in real-world situations. The major mathematical ideas in the Geometry course include geometric transformations, proving geomet- ric theorems, congruence and similarity, analytic geometry, right-triangle trigonometry, and probability.
