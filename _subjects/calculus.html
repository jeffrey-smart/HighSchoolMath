*FIX ME* The Algebra II course extends students’ understanding of functions and real numbers and increases the tools
students have for modeling the real world. Students in Algebra II extend their notion of number to include complex
numbers and
see how the introduction of this set of numbers yields the solutions of polynomial equations and the Funda- mental
Theorem of Algebra. Students deepen their under- standing of the concept of function and apply equation-solving and
function concepts to many different types of functions. The system of polynomial functions, analogous to integers, is
extended to the field of rational functions, which is analogous to rational numbers. Students explore the relationship
between exponential functions and their inverses, the logarithmic functions. Trigonometric functions are extended to all
real numbers, and their graphs and properties are studied. Finally, students’ knowledge of statistics is extended to
include under- standing the normal distribution, and students are challenged to make inferences based on sampling,
experiments, and observational studies. As per the <a
