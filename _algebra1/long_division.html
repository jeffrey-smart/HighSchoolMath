Long Division
</br>
</br>

<p>
    When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

    There may be one (repeated) real root,
    two (distinct) real roots, or
    complex roots (complex conjugates), which are \(a \pm b i \), where \(i = \sqrt{-1} \).

<p>
    For \(a, b, c \in \mathbb{C}\):
